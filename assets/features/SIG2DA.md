Trading signals are recommendations to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a specific time and price. These signals are generated by advanced algorithms (AI) and are supported by the expertise of experienced traders.

- A trader gets a ready-made hint, instead of searching for promising variants on their own
- Stop-loss and take-profit are also indicated in the signals, as well as additional notifications for trade control
