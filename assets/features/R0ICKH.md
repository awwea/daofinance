Active Management Funds (AMFs) aim to outperform market returns through investments selected by professional asset managers. These funds offer many of the same benefits as passively managed funds, such as price transparency, liquidity, and tax efficiency, but with the added advantage of a fund manager who can adapt to changing market conditions.

### Vision of Bitcoin

Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency (a virtual currency) designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity. This removes the need for trusted third-party involvement (e.g., a mint or bank) in financial transactions.

### Key Features:

- Stake currency is BTC (Bitcoin)
- You will realize profits automatically
- After the contract period, your invested capital and profits will be paid out in BTC
- Additional payments of $100 or more are possible at any time
